# Fall16-Team25

#Abstract

We propose a solution to eliminate trouble in managing events in school where parent participate by judging the event.
Our approach is to collaborate organizer and parent together with less effort. Organizer uses web application to monitor
event information, he can access parent list of mail id's to send invites for event. Parent uses mobile application to accept
or decline invites. Parent attendance in the event can be done by scanning the parent QR code using QR scanner. We propose 
a filter algorithm to filter out parents as judges and also backup judges for every team debate. Filter algorithm will 
discard parent as a judge if participant of that team is related to him. Results of this filtered are documented on a 
sheet, so that organizer can view the sheet and make announcements according to the sheet.
