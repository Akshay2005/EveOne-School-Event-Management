Considering that school admins have accounts already created. 

1.	school admin will create an event and would be admin of that event. Considering that one school will host event. 
    Admin will create event and set criteria and rules of event.

2.  Host will send invites to selected schools. 

3.  Invitee could accept or decline the invite. 
      On decline/accept of invitation, host will receive notification of action.  
      On accept invitee will be asked for team details and csv of parent database(name,email).

4.  Filter algorithm will filter out judges from the parent database list from system database. 
    It also filters out reserve judges. These filtered results will be filled in sheet.

5.  Admin can send mail invites to parents and parents would accept or reject invite.

6. This information will be adjusted in the sheet accordingly.

7.  Parent attendance at the event will be updated on this sheet as and when parent confirm their attendance.

8.  Admin can send announcements through application, either to all judges or selected judges.

Our approach is to avoid maintaining student data as it is not required. We focus on parent data(name, email).
