Considering that school admins have accounts already created. 

1.	school admin will create an event and would be admin of that event. Considering that one school will host event. 
    Admin will create event and set criteria and rules of event.

2.  Host will send invites to selected schools. 

3.  Invitee could accept or decline the invite. 
      On decline/accept of invitation, host will receive notification of action.  
      On accept invitee will be asked for team details and parent details(name,email) of their school.

4.  Admin will invite all parents of participating schools. Filter algorithm will filter out judges and reserve judges from list of paents who accepted the invitation. These filtered results will be filled in a mapping.

6.  On event day algorithm mails parents for attendance. Parents can mark their attendance through e-mail, This information will be adjusted in the mapping accordingly.

7.  Admin can send announcements through application, either to all judges or selected judges during the whole process.

Our approach is to avoid maintaining student data as it is not required. We focus on parent data(name, email).
